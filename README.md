# Taskinator

###Deployed Link

##Description

This project entailed building a task-tracker application. This task-tracker will allow the user to create tasks by entering a task name into the application, selecting a type, and clicking an "Add Task" button to organize these tasks into the following lists by using dropdown menus to change task status:
- Tasks To Do
- Tasks In Progress
- Tasks Completed

To achieve this task-tracker application the following were involved:
1. HTML and CSS to create the basic structure and design.
2. Document object and its relationship to HTML.
3. DOM API methods to handle button clicks.
4. Creation of development branches in GitHub.
5. Accessing the DOM element with JavaScript.
6. Creation, manipulation and styling of DOM elements.
7. Use of DOM API methods to select and generate HTML elements and content. 
8. Traversing the DOM and manipulation of elements.
9. Use of localStorage to maintain persistence.
10. Refactor of codebase to accomodate persistence.
